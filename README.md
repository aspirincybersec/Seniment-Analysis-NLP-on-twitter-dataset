# Sentiment Analysis NLP on Twitter Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on a Twitter dataset. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. In this project, we focus on analyzing sentiments in tweets from the Twitter platform.

## Features

- **Twitter Dataset:** The code in this repository is designed to work with a Twitter dataset. You can easily replace it with your own dataset or use the provided sample data.

- **NLP Techniques:** The sentiment analysis is performed using various NLP techniques, including tokenization, word embeddings, and machine learning models.

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The project includes Jupyter notebooks for each step of the analysis. This makes it easy to understand and reproduce the results.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sentiment-Analysis-NLP-on-twitter-dataset.git
   cd Sentiment-Analysis-NLP-on-twitter-dataset
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Twitter Dataset:**
   You can either use the provided sample dataset or replace it with your own Twitter dataset. Make sure the dataset is in a format compatible with the code.

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks:**
   Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the order of their numbering. Each notebook corresponds to a specific step in the sentiment analysis process.

## Notebooks

1. **01_data_preprocessing.ipynb:**
   This notebook covers the preprocessing steps for the Twitter dataset, including cleaning and tokenization.

2. **02_feature_extraction.ipynb:**
   Here, we extract features from the preprocessed data. This may involve techniques like word embeddings or other NLP methods.

3. **03_model_training.ipynb:**
   The machine learning model is trained in this notebook using the features extracted in the previous step.

4. **04_sentiment_analysis.ipynb:**
   Finally, the trained model is applied to perform sentiment analysis on new data.

## Results

The results of the sentiment analysis, including accuracy metrics and visualizations, can be found in the respective Jupyter notebooks.
